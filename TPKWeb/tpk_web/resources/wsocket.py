tpk_web.resources.wsocket - This package contains all the WebSocket views.

These views are designed for frequent and quick updates, either broadcasting
a message to the players, updating a single value on a character, or updating
the map for all players. Authentication, character uploads, and beginning
sessions should be handled by the ``rest`` module.
